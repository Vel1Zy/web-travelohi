# Travelohi ‚úàÔ∏è (March, 2024)

Travelohi is a web application inspired by the popular travel booking platform, Traveloka. This project serves as a full-stack development exercise, integrating a Go (Golang) backend with a React frontend.

A key feature of this application is an **AI-powered location recognition model**. Users can upload an image of a location, and the model will predict the country where the photo was taken.

## About The Project

This project was built to demonstrate proficiency in modern web development and machine learning integration. It includes a complete REST API for handling data, a responsive user interface, a secure authentication system, and a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) served via a Flask API.

The primary goal is to replicate the core user experience of a travel booking website while showcasing the ability to build and deploy an end-to-end AI model.

- **Secure User Authentication:** Users can register and log in using a system secured by JWT.
- **Dual REST APIs:** A Go API for core application logic and a Python/Flask API for serving AI predictions.
- **Dynamic Frontend:** A responsive and interactive UI built with React.
- **Travel Product Browse:** Users can view lists of available flights and hotels.
- **Booking Simulation:** A simplified process for users to create bookings.

## ü§ñ AI Model: Location Recognition

The core of the AI functionality is a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to identify a location's country from an image. The model and its training process are detailed in the `AlexNet_final_AI23_2.ipynb` notebook.

### Model Details

- **Architecture**: The model is a custom sequential CNN inspired by the **AlexNet** architecture. It consists of multiple `Conv2D` layers with `BatchNormalization` and `MaxPooling2D`, followed by `Dense` layers with `Dropout` to prevent overfitting.
- **Input**: The model expects a **224x224** pixel RGB image.
- **Output**: It provides a probability distribution across 6 classes using a `softmax` activation function. The classes are:
  - `Brazil`, `Canada`, `Finland`, `Japan`, `United-Kingdom`, `United-States`

### Data & Training

- **Preprocessing**: As noted in the notebook, images undergo augmentation (`shear`, `zoom`, `horizontal_flip`) and an experimental `GaussianBlur` is applied to see its effect on performance.
- **Data Handling**: To preserve valuable data, a small number of `Unlabeled` images in the training set were merged into the `Finland` class, which had the fewest samples.
- **Training**: The model was compiled using a **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** optimizer and the `CategoricalCrossentropy` loss function. In addition to accuracy, `Top-3 Categorical Accuracy` was tracked as a key metric to evaluate performance.

### Deployment

- The trained model (`.h5` file) is deployed using a lightweight **Flask** backend. This creates a dedicated API endpoint that receives an image file, preprocesses it, and returns the model's prediction as a JSON response.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.18 or higher)
